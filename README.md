# MOPSO-optimizing_delay_and_leakage_power_in_full_adder
Transistor re-sizing for optimization of leakage and delay power in a 45nm MGK full adder using an evolutionary algorithm called multiobjective particle swarm optimization(MOPSO).The leakage power in the cirsuit was reduced by 50%.The optimal dimensions were extracted from the pareto front after the algorithm converged.
